# Seven simple coding rules for good code

## 1. Separate function when one function goes over one page
12 "notebook standard, usually including comment lines up to 25 lines.

## 2. Separate functions if the indentation goes over two levels
When a for statement or an if statement occurs, think about it once again.

## 3. Separate by function if you need to write comments
When the semantics are separated, the annotation is expressed by the function name.

## 4. When the type of processed data is added, separate into modules (files) or classes
A program is basically a combination of data and algorithms that deal with that data.

## 5. Must use lint, format tool
The recommended lint and format rules almost contain the best practices.

## 6. Start with a refactoring line before adding / modifying features
It is also good to warm up brain

## 7. Start with just one test case
Although not immediately available, it's easy to add tests when adding, modifying, or refactoring features.
